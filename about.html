      <h2>I'm Fred. A frontend developer in the making.</h2>
      <div class="about-text-long">
        <p>
          Originally from Sweden, I've found my way to the vibrant streets of
          Oslo. For nearly a decade, I immersed myself in the dynamic world of
          retail, navigating through the ever-changing landscape of consumer
          trends and customer experiences. But one day, I felt the stirring of a
          new chapter beckoning me—a desire to delve into the realms of
          technology and digital creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023, I took a leap of faith and embarked on a journey of
          self-discovery at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media. It
          was here that I found my passion for frontend development, unlocking
          the doors to a world where pixels and codes merge to create digital
          marvels. Each line of code became a brushstroke, crafting immersive
          online experiences that captivate and engage users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond my love for all things tech, I find solace and joy in the
          simple pleasures of life. Movies have always been my escape,
          transporting me to distant lands and weaving tales of adventure and
          romance. Concerts, with their pulsating rhythms and electrifying
          energy, hold a special place in my heart, reminding me of the power of
          music to unite souls and transcend boundaries. And amidst the hustle
          and bustle of daily life, I find serenity in tending to my cherished
          collection of plants, nurturing them with care and watching them
          flourish under my green thumb.
        </p>
        <p>
          Life is a tapestry woven from countless threads of experiences and
          passions, and I'm committed to embracing every moment with curiosity
          and enthusiasm. So whether I'm crafting lines of code or lost in the
          melodies of a live performance, I'm always eager to explore, learn,
          and create. Join me on this journey as we navigate the digital
          landscape and embrace the beauty of life's little wonders together.
