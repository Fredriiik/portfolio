      <p>
        In my two years of studying frontend development, I have built a strong foundation in web technologies, user
        experience, and modern development workflows. I’m skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have expanded my
        knowledge with frameworks like React and tools such as Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap. My coursework has covered
        industry best practices, project management, development platforms, and efficient workflows. I have also gained
        experience in API integration and working with CMS platforms. With a strong focus on both design and
        functionality, I’m ready to create responsive, user-friendly, and dynamic web applications.

            I developed a modern and responsive booking platform for Holidaze, allowing users to search for, book, and
            manage accommodations. The project features a dynamic customer-facing interface for browsing venues and
            making
            reservations, as well as an admin panel where venue managers can create, update, and manage listings and
            bookings. Built with React and Bootstrap, the platform integrates seamlessly with a RESTful API to provide
            real-time availability, authentication, and user role management.

            I built a modern and responsive auction platform, allowing users to list items for bidding, place bids on
            auctions, and manage their credits. The project features a seamless bidding experience with auction
            listings,
            real-time bid updates, and user account management. Built with HTML, Bootstrap, SCSS, and JavaScript, the
            platform integrates with the Noroff Auction API to ensure a dynamic and engaging user experience.

            I created a sleek and user-friendly auction website that enables users to list items for bidding and place
            bids on auctions created by others. New users receive 1000 credits upon registration, which they can use to
            bid or earn by selling items. The platform supports user authentication, avatar updates, and real-time
            bidding
            functionality. Non-registered users can browse listings, while registered users can fully interact with the
            auction system. Built with HTML, Bootstrap, SCSS, and JavaScript, the site integrates seamlessly with the
            Noroff Auction API to ensure a dynamic and engaging bidding experience.
